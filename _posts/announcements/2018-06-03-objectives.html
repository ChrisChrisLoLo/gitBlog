<p>Hi, thanks for visiting my website!</p>
<p>In this post I am going layout the general tone/content of this blog so that I can hopefully keep it fairly consistant.</p>
<p>
  My primary goal of this web log is to keep track my progress in terms of learning and practicing new programming concepts,
  whether it be something like a new framework/language to how I created one of my web apps.
  I figure doing so will be a good way of showing others as well as myself how I am progressing in terms of learning certain skillsets.
  The logs should also be a good way of keeping track of how I did a particular thing, such as setting up a Heroku app, so that way
  I can reference how to repeat such a thing relatively easily.
  The logs also will contain information of how I felt about my projects as well as other web apps from a design perspective so I can 
  keep track of my thoughts if/when I want to make a new toy project.
</p>
<p>
  This blog will <i>NOT</i> contain any opinions outside of the scope of the blog.
  The contents of this blog should not contain any political opinions, unless horribly misconstrued by the reader.
  This blog should not contain large amounts of personal opinions either, unless they are relevant to
  the scope of this blog. 
  This blog should also maintain a fairly cut and dry tone, with as few jokes as I can, so I don't come
  back here in 2 years and cringe at awful attempts at humour.
</p>
<p>
  This blog could also be expanded and revised to offer tutorials as well more public interaction.
  However getting my content read is on the back-burner, as the blog is more geared to keep track of
  thoughts and my progression. I'm also not too interested in tutorials at this point in time, since
  there are a plethora of tutorials out there by professionals, and tutorials that I can currently offer
  may not present the optimal way to approach a problem. That being said doing tutorials in a couple of years
  sounds like a fair amount of fun.
